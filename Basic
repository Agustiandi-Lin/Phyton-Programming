# basic phyton note

# display something
print ('hello world') # add ' for string
print (3) # for int just type it

# to know whether its string or int
print(type ('hi'))
print(type(3))

# conversion
# int (x) --> x (string) int
# str (x) --> x (int) str
# float (x) --> x become float ; ex. float = 3.2

# insert variable
x = 'yo' # string var
y = 3 # int var
print (x)
print (y)

# mathematical operation (int)
# + = plus
# - = minus
# / = division (// = round down in division result)
# * = multiplication
# ** = exponentiation
# % = modulus (whats left after the division)

# mathematical operation (string)
# + = concatenation --> joining strings by linking them end to end
# * = multiplication --> must combine with int, ex. 2*"string"

# mathematical rule (PEMDAS) tier list
# 1. Parentheses "()"
# 2. Exponentiation "**"
# 3. Multiplication_Division "*" "/"
# 4. Plus_Minus "+" "-"

# ask for input
z = input("ask something \n") # \n = new line
print('thing that you type before is '+str(z))
